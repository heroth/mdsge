This is matlab code to estimate nonlinear state space models.

We have several different filters.

1. Kalman filter for linear Gaussian models.

to do: transscribe kalman.ox to matlab kalman.m

2. Smolyak Kalman filter. A simple filter based on deterministic integration.
to do: transcribe smolyakkalman.ox to matlab smolyakkalman.m

3. Particle filter. A simple filter based on sequential importance resampling.
to do:

4. Smolyak particle filter. A mixture of 2. and 3.
to do:

Moreover we have a Metropolis-Hasting sampler for parameter posterior estimation.

5. Metroplis-Hastings
mh.m			the metroplis-hastings algorithm
mh_plot.m		plot the density estimation
mh_print.m		print some statistics of the density estimation
mh-example-normal.mh	example with normal density

to do: adjust to the filter estimation needs

Finally we need to specify model files hadled to the estimation routines.

6. model

to do: think about structure

The code shoudl have some example files.

7. main-example-1
8. main-example-2

to do: add some examples
