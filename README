This is matlab code to estimate nonlinear state space models.

We have several different filters.

1. Kalman filter for linear Gaussian models.
2. Smolyak Kalman filter. A simple filter based on deterministic integration.
3. Particle filter. A simple filter based on sequential importance resampling.
4. Smolyak particle filter. A mixture of 2. and 3.

Moreover we have a Metropolis-Hasting sampler for parameter posterior estimation.

5. Metroplis-Hastings

Finally we need to specify model files hadled to the estimation routines.

6. model

The code shoudl have some example files.

7. main-example-1
8. main-example-2
